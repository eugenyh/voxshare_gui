In both cases logo.png file should be at the same location as voxshare_gui_XXX.py or voxshare_gui_XXX.exe file. 

## üîß How it works

1. **Audio Input**: VoxShare captures audio from the selected microphone in real-time.
2. **Push-to-Talk**: Audio is transmitted only while the push-to-talk button is held down.
3. **Multicast UDP**: Audio packets are sent over a multicast UDP channel to all clients in the local network.
4. **Volume Meter**: A volume meter displays your current speaking volume.
5. **Audio Output**: Received audio packets are played through the selected output device.
6. **Client Discovery**: Clients periodically broadcast small `PING` packets to detect active peers.
